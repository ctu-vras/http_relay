Description: Relay HTTP requests from local host to a remote host.
 This HTTP relay properly processes also the nonstandard HTTP responses like `ICY 200 OK` produced by Shoutcast or NTRIP streaming servers.
 The relay works properly with hostnames, IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses can be specified with or without `[]`.
